/**
 * XML document.

 * <p>Set of convenient XML manipulations:
 *
 * <pre> XML xml = new XMLDocument(content);
 * for (XML employee : xml.nodes("//Employee")) {
 *   String name = employee.xpath("name/text()").get(0);
 *   // ...
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can always get DOM node out of this abstraction using {@link #inner()}
 * or {@link #deepCopy()} methods.
 *
 * <p>{@code toString()} must produce a full XML.
 *
 * <p>Implementation of this interface must be immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * <p> In most cases, you can use the {@link XMLDocument} implementation. It
 * implements all required features and will be sufficient for most practical tasks.
 * The only problem with that implementation is that it uses javax.xml classes under
 * the hood. The issue with the default java implementation is that it only supports
 * XPath 1.0. If you require XPath 2.0 support and beyond, you can use the Saxon
 * implementation of {@link XML} - {@link SaxonDocument}. It is based on the Saxon
 * library and supports XPath 2.0 and higher.
 * You can read more about Java XPath versioning problems in the following threads:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6624149/xpath-2-0-for-java-possible">xpath 2.0 for java possible</a></li>

    /**
     * Find and return text elements or attributes matched by XPath address.
     *
     * <p>The XPath query should point to text elements or attributes in the
     * XML document. If any nodes of different types (elements, comments, etc.)
     * are found in result node list -
     * a {@link RuntimeException} will be thrown.
     *
     * <p>Alternatively, the XPath query can be a function or expression that
     * returns a single value instead of pointing to a set of nodes. In this
     * case, the result will be a List containing a single String, the content
     * of which is the result of the evaluation. If the expression result is not
     * a String, it will be converted to a String representation and returned as
     * such. For example, a document containing three &lt;a&gt; elements,
     * the input query "count(//a)", will return a singleton List with a single
     * string value "3".
     *
     * <p>This is a convenient method, which is used (according to our
     * experience) in 95% of all cases. Usually you don't need to get anything
     * else but a text value of some node or an attribute. And in most cases
     * you are interested to get just the first value
     * (use {@code xpath(..).get(0)}). But when/if you need to get more than
     * just a plain text - use {@link #nodes(String)}.
     *
     * <p>The {@link List} returned will throw {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException}
     * if you try to access a node which wasn't found by this XPath query.

     * <p>An {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown if the parameter
     * passed is not a valid XPath expression.
