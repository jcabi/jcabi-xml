Also, read this blog post: [Java XML Parsing Made Easy](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/24/java-xml-parsing-and-traversing.html).

It's a simple wrapper around DOM that makes XML parsing and printing
easy and simple, for example:

```java
XML xml = new XMLDocument("<orders><order id="4">Coffee to go</order></orders>");
String id = xml.xpath("//order/@id").get(0);
String name = xml.xpath("//order[@id=4]/text()").get(0);
System.out.println(xml.toString());
```
